# SynapticCacheNetwork

EDIT: This will now be worked on through my MSc Project.

Python implemented neural network that tracks synaptic changes. It assumes energy is proportional to the change in synaptic strength. Adapted from: https://elifesciences.org/articles/50804 (source code: https://github.com/vanrossumlab/li_vanrossum_19)
